Mac pbcopy/pbpaste are cool, but even better with named buffers.

```
Usage: $0 <verb> [tag]
  c[opy] [tag]   - pbcopy with optional storage
  p[aste] [tag]  - pbpaste with optional storage
  s[tore] <tag>  - put contents of pasteboard in storage
  g[imme] <tag>  - retrieve named storage into pasteboard
  l[ist]         - show tags
  e[dit] [tag]   - edit a tag, or just use a temporary buffer
  d[elete] <tag> - you get the idea
```
First letter of verb is enough.
